# Classes And Instances Lab Ruby

## Objectives

# 1. Define new Ruby classes with the `class` keyword.
# 2. Instantiate instances of a `class`.

# ## Overview

# This lab is all about defining classes and instantiating instances.

# ### 1. Define `Dog` in `lib/dog.rb`

# Open `lib/dog.rb` and add a class definition for a `Dog` class.

# ### 2. Make 3 dogs in `lib/dog.rb`

# Under your `Dog` class definition, create three dogs in local variables, `fido`, `snoopy`, and `lassie`.
